`mkdocs-auto-tag-plugin` is a plugin for [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), allows you to tag files based on their path.
It is being developed, since I have many pages with similar headlines contents in different folders, which are for different aspects of a thing.
However it is hard to differentiate them when using `Material for MkDocs`'s search, so I hope that I can make it easier by tagging the pages according to their category. 

## Features

- Automatically assign tags based on file names or paths
    - Match via [globs](/usage/#globs), no need to understand regular expressions.
- Designed to work with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), but should probably work with tag plugins too.

Then click `Next` or use the search function (in the top right corner) to learn more.
