# Tests

This directory contains the test files.
The tags of each file should be visible above the headline.

## Description

This documentation has an example of the problem I heave encountered.
There exist many similar pages about different programs all called `whoami`.
To select the correct one using the search, you can use the tag, that is added by this plugin (since each operating system has a different folder).

Start the search and just type `whoami` or [click here](?q=whoami) to see how confusing it is. :D

Then try adding `linux` or `macos` to the query and notice how the tags maake it much easier to see the tags.
